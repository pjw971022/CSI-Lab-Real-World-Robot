[Explain Environment 6] : In the photo, there are two objects: a cardboard box and a white rectangular object. The box is open, with flaps extended outward, and is positioned to the left of the white object. The box is brown with text on one side, while the white object appears solid and featureless. The box is larger in width and height compared to the white object, which is smaller and closer to the foreground. Both objects are oriented with their longest sides parallel to the bottom edge of the photo.

[Explain Environment 9] : The photo shows two plastic cups: one pink and one blue. They are placed on a flat surface with the pink cup on the left and the blue cup on the right, slightly spaced apart. Both cups appear to be of similar size, roughly 10 cm in height and 8 cm in diameter, with no rotation, standing upright. The pink cup has a handle on the left side, while the blue cup does not have a visible handle.

[Explain Environment 10] : In the photo, there are three objects: a transparent plastic container with a fan lid, a pink cup, and a blue cup inside it, and a red and black tumbler to the right. The container is centrally located, with the cups inside it and the tumbler adjacent to its right. The container and cups are various shades of transparent pink and blue, while the tumbler is red with a black top. The container appears to be about 15-20 cm in height and width, the cups are smaller, and the tumbler is slightly taller and narrower. All objects are upright with no rotation.
