[Explain Environment 4] : In the photo, there are two objects: a baseball and a plastic container. The baseball, with red and blue markings, is to the left of the container and is smaller in size, with a diameter of about a quarter of the container's height. The plastic container is translucent with a white lid, and it's positioned upright with no rotation. The container is larger, approximately four times the height of the baseball and twice as wide. Both objects are on a flat surface with a black background.

[Explain Environment 5] : The photo shows two objects: a blue plastic plate on the left and a red toy car on the right. The plate is flat and circular, approximately half the width of the car, which is a small-scale model with details suggesting it's a fire department vehicle. The plate and car are on a flat surface, with the plate lying flat and the car positioned upright on its wheels, both parallel to the camera's perspective. The car's size appears to be about twice the length of the plate's diameter. There is no significant rotation of either object; they are oriented with their tops facing upwards.

[Goal 5] : Pick up and drop a toy car into a paper plate.
{Robot speed : Normal }
[Plan 1] Pick up the red toy car.
{Grip Orientation : Top Grip }
{Gripper grabbing position : Middle }

[Explain Environment 6] : The photo shows two objects: a cardboard box and a white rectangular object. The box is open, with flaps extended outward, and is positioned to the left of the white object. The box is brown with text on one side, while the white object appears solid and featureless. The box's dimensions suggest it is larger than the white object, which seems to be about half the box's width. Both objects are on a flat surface, and neither is rotated in any significant way; they are oriented with their longest sides parallel to the bottom edge of the photo.

[Goal 6] : Pick up a sponge and place it into a box.
{Robot speed : Normal }
[Plan 1] Pick up the sponge.
{Grip Orientation : Top Grip }

[Explain Environment 7] : The photo shows two objects: a green plastic basket and a yellow and green plastic toy hammer. The hammer is placed diagonally across the basket, with the head inside and the handle extending out. The basket is bright green, rectangular, and appears to be about 30 cm in width, 20 cm in height, and 40 cm in length. The hammer is yellow with a green head, around 30 cm in length. The basket is upright, and the hammer is rotated so that the handle points away from the camera at a downward angle.

[Explain Environment 8] : In the photo, there are two objects: a travel mug and a tennis ball. The travel mug is on the left, red with a silver band and black top, approximately 15 cm in height and 7 cm in diameter. The tennis ball is on the right, bright green with a white curved line, about 6.5 cm in diameter. Both objects are upright with no rotation, and they are placed on a flat, dark surface with the mug closer to the camera than the ball.

[Explain Environment 9] : The photo shows two plastic cups: one pink and one blue. They are placed on a flat surface with a black background. The pink cup is on the left and slightly in front of the blue cup, which is on the right. Both cups appear to be of similar size, roughly 10 cm in height and 8 cm in diameter. They are upright, with no rotation.

[Explain Environment 10] : In the photo, there are three objects: a transparent plastic container with a fan lid, a pink cup, and a blue cup inside it, and a red and black tumbler to the right. The container is central, the pink cup is visible on the left inside the container, the blue cup is partially obscured behind the pink cup, and the tumbler is tilted and placed to the right of the container. The container and cups are medium-sized, while the tumbler is slightly taller. The container and cups are upright, and the tumbler is tilted at an angle.
